# RWmisc

This package contains convenience functions I have written to make
presenting results from MCMC estimation of Bayesian models easier (both
numerically and graphically) and to help deal with spatial data spread
across multiple UTM zones. There are also assorted other functions Iâ€™ve
found helpful in cleaning and reshaping datasets frequently used in the
study of conflit.

## Installation

You can install RWmisc from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

## Examples

See the [vignette on presenting MCMC model
output](https://jayrobwilliams.github.io/RWmisc/articles/Presenting%20MCMC%20model%20results.html)
for how to use the MCMC model function in this package.
