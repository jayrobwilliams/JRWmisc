# RWmisc

This package contains convenience functions I have written to help deal
with spatial data spread across multiple UTM zones and aggregating
raster data to overlapping polygons.

## Installation

You can install RWmisc from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```
