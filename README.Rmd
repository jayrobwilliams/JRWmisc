# RWmisc

This package contains convenience functions I have written to help deal with
spatial data spread across multiple UTM zones and aggregating raster data to
overlapping polygons.

## Installation

You can install RWmisc from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
remotes::install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```
