# RWmisc

This package contains convenience functions I have written to make presenting
results from MCMC estimation of Bayesian models easier (both numerically and
graphically) and to help deal with spatial data spread across multiple UTM zones.
There are also assorted other functions I've found helpful in cleaning and reshaping
datasets frequently used in the study of conflit.

## Installation

You can install RWmisc from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jayrobwilliams/RWmisc")
```

## Examples

Coming soon!
